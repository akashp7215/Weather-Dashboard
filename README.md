# Weather-Dashboard
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This fully functional weather interface allows the user to input any city they wish to view weather data on. Upon pressing "Enter" the user will be introduced to the current temperature, humidity levels, UV Index, and a 5 day weather forecast. Every inputted city will be saved to local storage to allow the user to refer back to a previously searched item with ease.
